This script is designed to automatically delete files within the temporary folder on your Windows system. It provides a convenient way to free up disk space and improve overall system performance. How to Use:

1. Clone the Repository:
  * Download the repository from GitHub or use a Git client to clone it to your local machine.
  * 
2. Build the Solution:
  * Open the solution file (.sln) in your preferred C# development environment (e.g., Visual Studio).
Build the project to compile the C# code.

3. Run the Executable:
  * Locate the compiled executable file TempDeleter.exe within the project's output directory.
  * Double-click the executable to run the script.

The script avoids deleting files that are currently in use, protected by the system, or inaccessible in any other way.
